We ask you to repeat those steps (particularly those in Question 3) so that we can compare the analysis models in this HW with those you developed in HW3.  In this HW we'll be using models from sklearn exclusively (as opposed to statsmodels)\n",

We do not need it, and its format cannot be used for analysis.  Also remove the `casual` and `registered` columns for both training and test datasets as they make  `count` trivial.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2** Since we'll be exploring Regularization and Polynomial Features, it will make sense to standardize our data.  Standardize the numerical features. Store the dataframes for the processed training and test predictors into the variables `X_train` and `X_test`.  Store the appropriately shaped numpy arrays for the corresponding train and test `count` columns into `y_train` and `y_test`.\n",

An example would be {'hum': 12.3, 'windspeed': -1.2, 'Sunday': 0.6 ... }\n",
