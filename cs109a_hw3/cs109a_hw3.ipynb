You will prepare a small report for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hourly demand information would be useful in planning the number of bikes that need to be available in the system on any given hour of the day, and also in monitoring traffic in the city. It costs the program money if bike stations are full and bikes cannot be returned, or empty and there are no bikes available. You will use multiple linear regression and polynomial regression and will explore techniques for subset selection. The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the total number of bike rentals in a given hour of the day, based on attributes about the hour and the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a suggestion to increase revenue might be to offer discounts during certain times of the day either during holidays or non-holidays. Your suggestions will depend on your observations of the seasonality of ridership.\n",
